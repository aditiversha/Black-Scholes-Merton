    "<b>What is the Black-Scholes-Merton Model?</b>\n",
    "- The Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model is a pricing model for financial instruments. It is used for the valuation of stock options. The BSM model is used to determine the fair prices of stock options based on six variables: volatility, type, underlying stock price, strike price, time, and risk-free rate. It is based on the principle of hedging and focuses on eliminating risks associated with the volatility of underlying assets and stock options."

    "<b>Assumptions of the Black-Scholes-Merton Model</b>\n",
    "- <b>Lognormal distribution:</b> The Black-Scholes-Merton model assumes that stock prices follow a lognormal distribution based on the principle that asset prices cannot take a negative value; they are bounded by zero.\n",
    "- <b>No dividends:</b> The BSM model assumes that the stocks do not pay any dividends or returns.\n",
    "- <b>Expiration date:</b> The model assumes that the options can only be exercised on its expiration or maturity date. Hence, it does not accurately price American options. It is extensively used in the European options market.\n",
    "- <b>Random walk:</b> The stock market is a highly volatile one, and hence, a state of random walk is assumed as the market direction can never truly be predicted.\n",
    "- <b>Frictionless market:</b> No transaction costs, including commission and brokerage, is assumed in the BSM model.\n",
    "- <b>Risk-free interest rate:</b> The interest rates are assumed to be constant, hence making the underlying asset a risk-free one.\n",
    "- <b>Normal distribution:</b> Stock returns are normally distributed. It implies that the volatility of the market is constant over time.\n",
    "- <b>No arbitrage:</b> There is no arbitrage. It avoids the opportunity of making a riskless profit.\n",
